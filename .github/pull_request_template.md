## Decisions / Choices I made

*This text should provide background information on the changes you did (optional). A great merge request answers at least the following question:*
*- Which architectural or implementation decisions did you make? And why?*

*Remember: The more information you give other developers, the easier it is for them 
to understand and review the code, and the more helpful their review will ultimately be.*
